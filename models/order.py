# from the form which can then be counted in the Meal class as an overall sales tracking tool?


# how to call in the meal.description from the meal class as a built-in variable?

# class Order:

#     def __init__(self, Meal.description, allmeals_qty, id = None):
#       self.Meal.description = meal_description
